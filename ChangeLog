Wed Jan 19 01:44:00 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (wormhole_interpret_this_obj): Bug fix.  rb_ary_new2()
	  do not set its length so we should not directly assign, just use
	  rb_ary_push() instead.

	* intervm.c (wormhole_dealloc): Bug fix.  Wormholes can how
	  contain immediates, so this RBASIC() should cause SIGSEGV.

Tue Jan 18 02:48:47 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (vm_create): When a VM was created, it has inherited its
	  parent VM's thread group.  This is a problem.  We kill that
	  here.  But there should be discussions whether this operation is
	  OK, because doing this makes a VM "escaped" from a thread group.
	  Care might be taken?

Mon Jan 17 13:43:07 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* gc.c (gc_mark_children): Add assertion again.  No inter-VM
	  objects should be stored onto another VM's object space.

	* parse.y (rb_id2str): This string's class should always be
	  updated because the string can be from other VM's object space,
	  and hence klass can point to another rb_cString from different
	  universe.

Sun Jan 16 22:48:30 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (rb_vm_start): now takes variable arguments.

Sun Jan 16 22:35:00 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_wormhole_peek): signaling pump can happen
	  prior to a wormhole allocation.

	* vm.c (vm_init2): Proper initialize.

Sun Jan  9 11:20:49 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* README: bit update.

Sat Jan  8 17:36:05 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_wormhole_send): can now send an array, as
	  long as it does not include any non-sendable objects.

Sat Jan  8 10:26:29 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (ruby_vm_join): should return something.

Sat Jan  8 09:29:39 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (InitVM_Wormhole): rename to RubyVM::Channel because
	  k1o doesn't like the former name.  Now struct wormhole is a pure
	  C data structure, Channel is a Ruby class.

Fri Jan  7 15:43:16 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* ext/fcntl/fcntl.c (InitVM_fcntl): MVM ready.

Fri Jan  7 15:40:30 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* ext/socket/socket.c (InitVM_socket): MVM ready.

Thu Jan  6 21:18:25 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* ext/etc/etc.c (InitVM_etc): MVM ready.

Thu Jan  6 21:07:48 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* gc.c (gc_mark_children): weaken the criteria; It may be a bug
	  though.

Thu Jan  6 21:01:11 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_str): smart clean rewrite.  Same effect.

Wed Jan  5 19:48:02 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* dln.c (dln_load): initial support for MVM-capable extensions.
	  Extensions shall have InitVM_ prefixed initializer function to
	  be required from inside of a VM.  Only the main VM can require
	  old-fashioned extensions.

Wed Jan  5 17:04:41 2011  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* dln.c (global_dln_handles): new global variable.

	* dln.c (Init_dln): new function to initialize above.

	* dmydln.c: ditto.

	* inits.c: ditto.

Wed Dec 22 10:53:03 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* parse.y (rb_id2str): intervm strings shall not be returned from
	  this function because they are not ready to be used directly.
	  Wrap them with a shared string.

Tue Dec 21 13:14:06 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm_core.h (rb_vm_struct): ref_count is no longer used; VMs
	  cannot live longer than their parent so a VM is now totally
	  handled by its parent.

Mon Dec 20 10:53:01 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* mvm.c: goodbye.

Mon Dec 20 07:15:59 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm_core.h (rb_vm_struct): they are no longer queues

	* thread.c: ditto.

	* vm.c: ditto.

Mon Dec 20 05:46:50 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (rb_vm_send): garbage code eliminated.  Checks are done in
	  the calling function.

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_wormhole_send): the check.

Mon Dec 20 05:34:00 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (wormhole_init_copy): bug fix that, when source object
	  was from outer-space, rb_obj_init_copy() does not work.

Mon Dec 20 04:25:36 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c, vm_core.h, thread.c, intervm.c: rb_queue_t removed also,
	  now signal handlings are done using wormholes.

Mon Dec 20 02:47:38 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c, vm_core.h, thread.c: bytestream reverted.

Fri Dec 17 19:01:07 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* thread.c (rb_vm_terminate_all_really_everything): avoid waiting
	  the runnign thread itself.

Fri Dec 17 13:45:32 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* signal.c (ATOMIC_INC, ATOMIC_DEC): uses intervm.h definition.

Fri Dec 17 13:43:13 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_wormhole_send): support for immediate values.

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_wormhole_recv): ditto.

Fri Dec 17 13:10:50 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c: New class and its implementation.  Much like a pipe,
	  behaves as a inter-VM communicaition channel.

Fri Dec 17 03:48:49 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.c (Final_intervm): New function to terminate the
	  inter-VM object space.

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_str): type fix

	* eval.c (ruby_at_exit): typo fix

	* intervm.c (Init_intervm): I thought it needs lock at first, but
	  now the implementation is totally lock-free.

	* eval.c (ruby_at_exit): this case needs recursion.

Fri Dec 17 02:08:21 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* include/ruby/intern.h (ruby_at_exit): process global finish-ups,
	  just like ruby_vm_at_exit.

	* eval.c (ruby_at_exit): but its implementation is totally
	  different.  This is becaus the process global finishups cannot
	  utilize Ruby's object system (because its lifetime is longer
	  than them).

	* eval.c (ruby_finalize): I believe the old implementation was wrong.

	* main.c (main): need a ruby_finalize() call.

Thu Dec 16 07:56:44 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* parse.y (sym_str_new): Uses intervm string.

	* parse.y (rb_id2str): Uses intervm string also; it was a bug to
	  return a cached string itself because that was not dedicated for
	  a current VM.

	* intervm.c (rb_intervm_str): case 1 was missing. Also needed care
	  for embed strings.

Thu Dec 16 07:22:51 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* intervm.h: New file.  This is an API to share datum among VMs.

	* intervm.c: Its implementation.

	* inits.c (rb_call_inits): call inits for intervm.c

	* string.c: Strings needs some care about sharing among VMs:
	  Inter-VM strings do not have their own GC so reference counts
	  should be manipulated properly.

	* gc.c (gc_mark_children): Now it is possible for an Object to
	  have references toward other VM's object spaces; should not mark
	  them on those cases.

Thu Dec 16 07:15:33 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* marshal.c (final_free_marshal_compat): should return.

	* class.c: gc.h needed for rb_free_m_table.

	* ruby.c (ruby_vm_process_options): what's this casting business?

	* vm_core.h: declaration needed.

Mon Dec 13 14:28:52 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* mvm.c (vm_join): join should wait for at least once.

Sat Dec 11 05:28:52 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* util.c (ACQUIRE_DTOA_LOCK): No free lunch any more; a gentle
	  locking is needed.

	* inits.c (rb_call_inits): ditto.

Sat Dec 11 05:20:11 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* util.c (scan_digits): Constify.  What is important here is the
	  data can be accessed simultaneously from multiple VMs.

Sat Dec 11 05:00:32 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* regparse.c (FreeNodeList): is a global static variable and shall
	  be divided into VMs.

	* inits.c (rb_call_inits): ditto.

Sat Dec 11 03:21:50 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* mvm.c (vm_join): Original condition never reached, because a
	  vm->living_threads will not be freed until the VM is GCed;
	  someone else is joining a VM means it still has the hash.

	* thread.c (thread_start_func_2): Main thread's graceful
	  shutdown neds to finish other threads of the same VM.

	* thread.c (rb_vm_terminate_all_really_everything): This is
	  abnormal shutdown; main thread might already be killed.

Sat Dec 11 01:25:15 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): fixme.  don't know why this is wrong.

Sat Dec 11 01:03:08 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (vm_free): the condition was wrong.

Sat Dec 11 00:32:02 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* thread.c (rb_vm_terminate_all_really_everything): New function.
	  On a process termination (not per-VM), termination of all
	  threads, without allowing a sanctuary, is mandatory.

	* vm.c (vm_knockin_on_the_heavens_door): move to thread.c

Sat Dec 11 00:03:58 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): use what we already have.

Fri Dec 10 21:36:08 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (vm_thread_new): might be a yer another merge miss.  A
	  thread made this way was initialized twice.

Fri Dec 10 19:14:44 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* thread.c (thread_start_func_2): They were double-free.

Fri Dec 10 18:56:07 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): current thread not always vm->main.
	  What we should avoid terminatiing is the current one.

Thu Dec  9 08:54:45 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* thread_pthread.c (get_stack): might also be a backport mistake.
	  attr shall be destroyed anyway.

Thu Dec  9 08:33:17 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* variable.c (FinalVM_generic_iv_tbl): at_exit function shall use
	  rb_vm_specific_ptr_for_specific_vm instead.

Thu Dec  9 07:26:51 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (rb_vm_initialize): this temporary string should be
	  zero-filled to prevent exception by non-ascii garbage.

Thu Dec  9 07:18:53 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (vm_data_type): might be a merge miss.  dfree shall be specified.

Thu Dec  9 07:02:05 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (InitVM_VM): rb_class_new creates a m_tbl, but a T_ICLASS
	  normally do not have one, so obj_free will leak it.  It is
	  unused anyway.

Thu Dec  9 06:46:13 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): vm->loading_table shall be freed.
	  On a normal run a vm->loading_table is empty, but I'm not sure
	  if it is always, so deleting its internals just for sure.

Thu Dec  9 06:26:07 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): vm->unlinked_method_entry_list shall
	  be sweeped.

Thu Dec  9 06:17:52 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): FinalVM_generic_iv_tbl needs (yet
	  another) special care.  When an objspace terminates it nees be.

Thu Dec  9 05:39:32 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* gc.c (rb_objspace_free): deferred finalizers shall be called here.

Thu Dec  9 04:55:10 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* variable.c (InitVM_global_iv_tbl): Well, prior to this change
	  rb_generic_iv_tbl was created using Data_Wrap_Struct, but this
	  was wrong, because that needs an object allocation, an object
	  allocation needs GC, and GC needs rb_generic_iv_tbl itself.

Thu Dec  9 04:16:39 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* parse.y (sym_str_new): rb_str_cat was also wrong idea, because
	  it can call xrealloc. symbols are handled in a dedicated
	  objspace so allocations should also happen inside of it.

Thu Dec  9 02:58:55 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm_core.h: type mismatch.

	* include/ruby/ruby.h : ditto.

	* mvm.c (ruby_vm_specific_ptr): ditto.

Thu Dec  9 01:18:55 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): vm->specific_storage.ptr had same
	  constraint as vm->cache.

Thu Dec  9 00:49:43 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): rb_ary_clear was insufficient,
	  because that can internally call realloc (for instance when the
	  array is shared).  Just leaving it to GC should suffice.

Thu Dec  9 00:09:58 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* include/ruby/vm.h: I believe this function can now handle
	  arbitrary pointers.

	* include/ruby/ruby.h: ditto.

	* mvm.c (ruby_vm_specific_ptr): ditto.

	* vm_core.h (rb_vm_struct): ditto.

	* ruby.c (proc_options): ditto.

	* io.c (ruby_vm_argf): ditto.

Wed Dec  8 22:31:15 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* marshal.c (final_free_marshal_compat): marshal_compat_t
	  variables shall be freed.

	* variable.c (unref_global_variable): typo fix

Wed Dec  8 22:06:40 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* variable.c (final_free_global_entry): global entries have
	  indirect references to other memory regions, which also shall be
	  freed.

	* variable.c (unref_global_variable): pulled up as a function.

	* variable.c (rb_alias_variable): use unref_global_variable.

Wed Dec  8 21:18:12 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): vm->cache needed when
	  rb_objspace_free runs, but after rb_objspace_free finished,
	  rb_objspace_xfree no longer possible.

Wed Dec  8 20:59:13 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): vm->mark_object_ary shall be flushed
	  prior to rb_objspace_free, otherwise objects might remain alive.

Wed Dec  8 20:29:44 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* marshal.c (free_compat_allocator_tbl): New function.  In the
	  first place, thie compat_allocator_tbl has been leaked ever
	  since it has been introduced.  I double-checked this on my
	  repo's annotation.  Once upon a time when we has only one VM per
	  a process, the leak was not a problem, because the hash table
	  survives entire process lifetime.  Now that we have multiple
	  VMs, VM termination is no longer connected to process
	  termination, and this hash is per VM, not per problem.  So the
	  leak is now a real problem.

	* marshal.c (InitVM_marshal): Register free_compat_allocator_tbl
	  to be kicked when this object is freed.

Wed Dec  8 19:48:31 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): vm->init_options shall be freed.

Wed Dec  8 19:43:15 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_make_bare_vm): This malloc generates an immediate
	  memory leak.  Might be a merge mistake.

Tue Dec  7 22:00:59 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* thread_pthread.c (native_thread_destroy): th->altstack shall be freed.

Tue Dec  7 21:36:36 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (FinalVM_redefined_flag): vm->opt_method_table shall be freed.

	* vm.c (vm_init_redefined_flag): revister FinalVM_redefined_flag

Tue Dec  7 19:24:33 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* variable.c (FinalVM_var_table): vm->global_symbol shall be freed

	* variable.c (InitVM_var_tables): register FinalVM_var_table

Tue Dec  7 18:57:13 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): they are forgot to be freed.

Tue Dec  7 18:52:14 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* thread_pthread.c (ruby_native_thread_choke): New function.  Once
	  upon a time when we has only one VM per a process, a thread was
	  terminated by a process termination.  This is because by
	  definition a VM exits when its entry point function exits, and
	  that was (almost) equivalent to when a process exits.  Now that
	  we have multiple VMs, VM termination is no longer connected to
	  process termination so we have lost our chance to finish
	  threads.

	* eval_intern.h: ditto.

	* vm.c (vm_knockin_on_the_heavens_door): GOTTA KNOCK A LI'L HARDER

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): Ensure threads termination.

Mon Dec  6 16:21:12 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* parse.y (Final_sym): New function.  Once upon a time when we had
	  only one VM per a process, a Symbol had a chance to pass away
	  when its process terminates itself, because the objspace a
	  Symbol was in was actually the single process-global objspace so
	  a objspace termination and process termination are 1 to 1
	  relationship.  Now that we have multiple VMs (thus multiple
	  objspaces), VM termination is no longer connected to process
	  termination so we have lost our chance to finalize global
	  objects, namely Symbols.

	* parse.y (Init_sym): Register Final_sym to be kicked when process
	  finishes.

Fri Dec  3 04:08:59 2010  NARUSE, Yui  <naruse@ruby-lang.org>

	* encoding.c (enc_alias_internal): use st_insert2 and change return
	  value to int.

	* encoding.c (enc_alias): follow enc_alias_internal.

Fri Dec  3 01:52:43 2010  NARUSE, Yui  <naruse@ruby-lang.org>

	* encoding.c (enc_alias_internal): use xfree instead of free.

Thu Dec  2 21:22:05 2010  NARUSE, Yui  <naruse@ruby-lang.org>

	* encoding.c (enc_alias_internal): free the copied key and
	  return NULL when given key is already regisitered.

	* encoding.c (enc_alias): call set_encoding_const only when the
	  alias is not registered yet.

Fri Dec  3 00:00:15 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* eval.c (ruby_vm_cleanup): bug fix around at_exit (1) timing was
	  wrong. (2) execution order was opposite.

Thu Dec  2 00:31:13 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* eval.c (ruby_vm_cleanup): Perhaps it would be more appropriate
	  for at_ext functions be called here,

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): than here.

Thu Dec  2 00:10:04 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (vm_free): A VM can not always be killed only because an
	  objspace has no reference to it; a VM can be seen "outside" of
	  itself.  Namely a VM's itself and its parent are not suitable
	  here to be freed.  Note however, that this criteria is a
	  heuristic given a VM "lives" in other VM's objspace and do not
	  move across a home ground VM i.e.  VMs holds parent-child
	  relationships.  If this is broken -- when a child lives longer
	  than a parent -- the situation gets much complex.

Wed Dec  1 19:35:54 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* gc.c (rb_objspace_free): Ensure to free objects.  Before this
	  there has been no chance for a object to be freed when a VM
	  shuts down, which led to memory leaks.  I'm still not sure if
	  rb_objspace_free is the right place to deallocate those as-yet
	  living objects so if someone thinks it isn't, please tell me.

Tue Nov 30 21:29:51 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* include/ruby/vm.h (ruby_vm_at_exit): new method.

	* mvm.c (ruby_vm_at_exit): new method.

	* vm_core.h (rb_vm_struct): new field.

	* vm.c (vm_init2): initialize the new field.

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): kick the functions.

Tue Nov 30 16:47:50 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): When reaching to this condition this
	  mutex is locked, and a locked mutex cannot be destroyed.
	  Personal impression: it is pthread's fault that a locked mutex
	  cannot be destroyed.  Instead I believe a mutex should be
	  destroyed under a lock.  Because when not locked another thread
	  might lock that mutex.  So for instance after this change,
	  another thread can gain a lock between those
	  native_thread_unlock() and native_thread_lock_destroy() calls,
	  and result in a broken behaviour.  If it were designed to need a
	  lock before a destruction that wont happen, because only one
	  thread can lock a specific mutex.

Tue Nov 30 16:11:00 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* mvm.c (vm_join): avoid breaking inside of a macro.

Tue Nov 30 15:42:11 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* eval.c (ruby_vm_cleanup): It was mistake to signal this cond
	  after all.

	* thread.c (thread_start_func_2): Instead signaling here.

Mon Nov 29 19:22:08 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* eval.c (ruby_vm_cleanup): According to Ko1, timer thread is per
	  process, not per VM.  So a cleanup of a VM cannot blindly stop
	  the timer thread.  However, there can be discussions whether the
	  timer thread belongs to the main VM.  A child VM might live
	  longer than a parent VM (design choice; that model can be) and
	  on such situation, the timer thread should not finish with the
	  main VM.  So this part is subject to change.

Mon Nov 29 15:37:49 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* README: memorandum.

Mon Nov 29 09:55:40 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm_core.h (rb_vm_specific_ptr_for_specific_vm): added.

	* include/ruby/vm.h (ruby_vm_specific_ptr): no need of vm to be
	  passed.

Sun Nov 28 05:01:06 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* eval.c (ruby_vm_cleanup): Not sure, but it seems
	  global_vm_waiting should also signaled here.  Maybe not.

Fri Nov 26 20:07:13 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (vm_init2): Reference count should start from zero.
	  Otherwise a if statement can never examine if a vm has no
	  reference.

	* vm.c (vm_create): It turned out that vm->ref_count is
	  incremented twice per a VM creation, thus it never reaches to
	  zero again.  This is definitely a bug.

	* vm.c (ruby_vmptr_destruct): Likewise a vm->parent->ref_count
	  will never been decremented and hence a ref_count of a vm
	  experiencing a child creation can never reache to zero.  Also a
	  bug.

Fri Nov 26 18:37:49 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (rb_vm_initialize): Rewrite argv passage mechanism using
	  ruby's normal array/string APIs.  This is because vm->argv, when
	  created here, shall be freed _after_ the VM itself has been shut
	  down.  But a sad thing is vm->argv in general does not always
	  need to, because the argv passed to the process itself is out of
	  its scope.  Detecting whether a argv memory region is under
	  control of process-intermal memory manager is not easy (i.e. not
	  portable), so instead of managing argv by hand, I decided to
	  leave it to GC.  The key part is rb_ivar_set call, which enables
	  our GC engine to detect a relationship between a VM and its
	  argv.

Tue Nov 23 07:22:54 2010  Nobuyoshi Nakada  <nobu@ruby-lang.org>

	* ChangeLog (change-log-indent-text): hunging indent.

Wed Nov 24 20:09:36 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* vm.c (rb_vm_start): ruby_threadptr_init will not create a
	  native thread.  Instead ruby_threadptr_create shall be
	  called here.

	* vm_core.h (ruby_threadptr_create): externed.

	* thread.c (ruby_threadptr_create): ditto.

Mon Nov  8 14:11:34 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* parse.y (sym_str_new): Need to untrust here. Not sure if we
	  should, though.  Without this modification a symbol creation
	  on higher safe levels causes SecurityError, which, infact,
	  seems to be as intended. c.f. [ruby-dev:39624].  But our
	  test does have codes which implyes those creation to be
	  legal.  So to pass them, I hereby insert this code.

Mon Nov  8 10:16:31 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* gc.c (rb_objspace_xmalloc, rb_objspace_xrealloc): Do not
	  invoke a garbage collection.  This is because: 1) these days
	  our GC tend to sweep lazily over an object space, so an
	  invocation of garbage_collect() will not immediately result
	  in a free memory at the moment, and 2) xmalloc() might be
	  invoked during a VM initialization.  On such situations GC
	  cannot work, because a GC context thread is not yet made up
	  properly.  In short doing GC on xmalloc-family routines is
	  anachronic, problematic.

Thu Nov  4 07:02:36 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* eval.c, file.c, inits.c, random.c, ruby.c, safe.c, thread.c,
	  vm.c, vm.h, vm_core.h: modernization reform.  Without this
	  the souce would not compile.  Even with this it wouldn't
	  pass make test.

Mon Nov  1 21:25:57 2010  URABE Shyouhei  <shyouhei@ruby-lang.org>

	* main.c: <stdlib.h> is needed, to introduce the getenv(3)
	  prototype declaration.  Without it a C compiler shall infer
	  the getenv type as "int getenv(...);", but this is totally
	  wrong, especially when your machine's sizeof(int) and
	  sizeof(char*) differs.  On such environment a return value
	  of getenv(3), which is in fact a char*, might first casted
	  into a int (loses data here), and then casted back to char*
	  by automatic integral promotion fo fit to the prototype of
	  ruby_set_debug_option().

	  initialize rb_vm_options.
