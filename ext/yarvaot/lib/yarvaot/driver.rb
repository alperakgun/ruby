       YARVAOT: a Ruby to C (and then, to machine executable) compiler.

HDR1
SYNOPSIS:

    #@arg0 [OPTS ...] [SUBCMD [OPTS ...]] SOURCE.rb

  where SUBCMD can be one of:

    preprocess                     Preprocess  a  ruby  code  to  do  necessary
                                   transforms  and higher-level  analysis, then
                                   output a transformed ruby script.
    compile                        Compile a  ruby code into a C  code that can
                                   then  be processed  by  a system-provided  C
                                   compiler.
    assemble                       This is  a wrapper to a  C compiler.  Gener-
                                   ates  a assembler-output machine  binary ob-
                                   ject from  a C source code  generated by the
                                   above compiler subcommand.
    link                           Links  every necessary libraries  and assem-
                                   bler outputs into  a single executable file,
                                   or a single ruby extension library.
